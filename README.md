# UTMN Database Management System
Assignments for UTMN Database Management System course (for one existing lab for now)

## Config

### DB connection params

Note that you should specify your DB connection options (would be in separate file soon) if you want to use it for linking your DB connection:

   ```python
     DB_ARGS = {
      "dbname": dbname,
      "user": username,
      "password": password,
      "host": host,
      "options": ...,
    }
   ```
`password` var is stored in `secret.py` in root directory, you should change it by yourself (implement it soon).
